**AI and Cybersecurity Education Chatbot**

This project *Enhancing AI and Cybersecurity Education
through Chatbot Engagement* is a part of the Virtual Internship Program by The International Center for AI and Cyber Security Research and Innovations (CCRI) at Asia University in Taiwan. This work focuses on developing ann educational chatbot for Artificial Intelligence and CyberSecurity.
Throughout the project,
we tried to create a functional chatbot that provides users with valuable resources, such as Youtube Videos, Online Quizzes, and Study Schedules related to CyberSecurity. The chatbot's ability to engage users through a conversational interface and direct them to relevant 
resources demonstrates its potential to an educational tool upon complete development.


The chatbot successfully integrates advanced AI features to manage conversations, under-
stand user inputs, and generate relevant responses. It also incorporates comprehensive
educational content modules, including tutorials, quizzes, case studies, and supplementary
resources, enhancing the overall learning experience. The final report for the project can be found at [Report PDF](https://github.com/kondaveetitejaswi/ai_and_cybersecurity_educational_chatbot/blob/main/Summer_Internship_Final_Project_Report.pdf).
